//output
{ firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Smith' }
So, the output { firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Smith' } reflects the state of module.exports after executing the IIFE, 
where exports has { firstname: 'John' } and lastname is 'Smith'. The getFullName function defined inside the IIFE does not affect the output 
since it's not returned or accessible outside the IIFE.
