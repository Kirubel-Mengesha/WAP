//output in node
undefined

//output in browser
Hello World

The reason for the different outputs lies in how JavaScript handles the this keyword in different environments
In Node.js, the output is 'undefined' because this.message doesn't exist in the global object, 
whereas in a browser environment, the output is 'Hello World' because this.message refers to the global message variable.
